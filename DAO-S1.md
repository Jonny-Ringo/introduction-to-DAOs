# DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organization
#### Let’s Break it down

## Decentralized
As denoted in the name, DAOs are decentralized entities of operation. But what does that mean?
This means they have no central authority, but rather rely on the authority of consensus (majority
agreement) in some form, by design.
To better understand what decentralization is, let’s go over the main types of
organizations/networks to understand the differences.

There are three basic types of organizations. *Centralized, Decentralized, and Distributed.*

**Centralized:** An organization or network with a centered entity of operation. This
organization is reliant on this central functioning owner or authority to govern its
operations overall. This is the most common type of organization in existence today.
Most corporations, banks, or businesses are considered centralized.

**Decentralized:** An organization or network that relies on an undefined number of
operators/holders without a singular central governing authority to operate. Instead,
overall governance authority relies on the consensus of all collective holders/operators.
These holders/operators must leverage their voting rights and/or equipment, to have a say
(vote) in the process of how the organization operates and functions. Anyone with a
"stake"(tokens, equipment, etc) in it has a right to vote using this vested interest.

**Distributed:** An organization or network that relies on numerous nodes/operators for
consensus, very similar to decentralization. However, these points of operation/governing
are not selected in the same "natural" manner of distribution (“natural” meaning: incentives,
voted token allotments, staking rewards, etc). These governing points are typically chosen
based on certain criteria, and given the authority from an original central source. These
organizations can become decentralized over time, depending on the distribution
mechanism for the remaining consensus authority (voting rights).
Now that we have compared the differences between the basic types of organizations, we
can better understand how decentralization stands apart from the others.

## Autonomous
Being capable of operating without direct human control. An autonomous application or
organization is one built to accept certain inputs from vested/involved members and perform
an action or function based on those inputs. These available inputs and actions are
predefined within the program or contract. Inputs from people define which functions are
executed, then are automatically performed.
DAO proposals, updates, and changes are all approved by the consensus of members (user
input), then automatically executed.

## Organization
A body of people organized with a particular purpose, such as a business, society,
association, or group. Even though DAOs are typically international, everyone
associated with it is working together for a common purpose in an organized manner.
