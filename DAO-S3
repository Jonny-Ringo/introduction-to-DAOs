# DAO Governance Participation

## How To Vote?

Now that we understand the basic types of organizations and what a DAO is, how do
we participate (vote) in one? This depends on how the DAO is set up to govern itself

### Node Consensus Model
In the node consensus model cases (Bitcoin for ex.), this happens with hardware supporters
of the network. Bitcoin nodes follow consensus rules, which are rules that are agreed upon
by the community. A change in the Bitcoin consensus rules or the protocol itself requires
95% of the operating node structure to approve and instate. “Voting” on any changes to the
network is done by physically instating the proposed change to the software/parameters on
each node. This means you must own hardware and run a network node on it. Once a
minimum consensus of the node operators is reached, the change is solidified and then the
rest of the remaining nodes need to update to the new rules/operating parameters to stay
in sync with the network properly.
This original network consensus model is the root of the DAO structure, which requires a
majority of participants to agree on any change made to the network or protocol to achieve
“consensus”. This majority requirement varies with each DAO.
