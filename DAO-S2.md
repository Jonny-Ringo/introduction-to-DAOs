## But, Why A DAO?
So why use a DAO? What makes it desirable over a traditional centralized organization such
as a bank, or corporation?

The answer is freedom of choice over what happens across the organization/network itself.
Every person who participates can choose/approve actions taken that affect it. We approve
or disapprove of these actions in an effort to be part of the evolving growth of this new
technology. If your favorite application ran like a DAO, you would be able to vote on or
approve any changes and updates to it. DAOs allow people to have direct input on important
decisions that involve things they are passionate about.
Open-source coding is one notable feature of DAOs. Decentralization at its core requires this
to maintain its nature of not having any 1 entity controlling it, and participants being fully
informed. DAO builders and contributors use public repositories such as Github to host,
share, and submit changes to the code for public review and approval. A DAO-like structure
can be formed using closed-source code, but in essence, this renders it centralized as one
entity controls the source code it is built on.
An alternative view of why to use the DAO structure is simplicity and low-cost basis. From a
business perspective, there can be many upsides to using this technology. DAOs can take the
place of corporate-type structures that are complex and expensive, making the process
cheaper and more intuitive.
