# DAO Governance Participation

## How To Vote?

Now that we understand the basic types of organizations and what a DAO is, how do
we participate (vote) in one? This depends on how the DAO is set up to govern itself

### Node Consensus Model
In the node consensus model cases (Bitcoin for ex.), this happens with hardware supporters
of the network. Bitcoin nodes follow consensus rules, which are rules that are agreed upon
by the community. A change in the Bitcoin consensus rules or the protocol itself requires
95% of the operating node structure to approve and instate. “Voting” on any changes to the
network is done by physically instating the proposed change to the software/parameters on
each node. This means you must own hardware and run a network node on it. Once a
minimum consensus of the node operators is reached, the change is solidified and then the
rest of the remaining nodes need to update to the new rules/operating parameters to stay
in sync with the network properly.
This original network consensus model is the root of the DAO structure, which requires a
majority of participants to agree on any change made to the network or protocol to achieve
“consensus”. This majority requirement varies with each DAO.

### Tokenized Governance Voting Model

Ethereum introduced a new type of DAO model that allowed developers to build token
contracts and DAOs on top of the existing blockchain structure. These tokens/DAOs could
create their own autonomous governance mechanisms, while the Ethereum blockchain
itself is governed by a node consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin’s in the overall
operation.
In the Tokenized Governance model, the holders of tokens called “voting rights” vote on
any changes to the DAO organization or protocol. Each token counts as an equal vote to
another and the power of any one voter is determined by how many of the tokens they
hold and will dedicate to this process(in most cases).

*Ex. If the total supply of tokens used for voting is 100, and 1 person holds 10 of these, then that
person’s voting power is 1/10, or %10 of the total available votes.*

There are three main types of tokenized governance voting. Staking weighted, holdings
weighted, and delegation voting. All of these types cost “gas” to execute each action
on-chain. All 3 types use the weight of the holder’s tokens to vote with in some fashion.
The difference is how the voting weight is determined and applied as votes.

*Note: Many tokens in DAO ecosystems can perform multiple functions of utility in addition to
being used to vote with.*
